This version of XV6 is a fork of https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public with
a handful of tweaks by Ted Cowan for use in his CS 3100 Operating Systems
class, taught at Weber State University.

CS 3100 students should clone this repository and follow the instructions
in the Lab writeups that require XV6.
